# WildShield

A blockchain-powered platform for decentralized wildlife conservation that prevents poaching through transparent funding, community incentives, and on-chain verification — empowering global users to protect endangered species and habitats.

---

## Overview

WildShield consists of four main smart contracts that together form a decentralized, transparent, and impactful ecosystem for wildlife conservation and poaching prevention:

1. **Conservation Token Contract** – Issues and manages tokens for donations, rewards, and staking.
2. **NFT Adoption Contract** – Handles NFTs representing adoptable animals or protected land parcels.
3. **Governance DAO Contract** – Enables community voting on conservation proposals and fund allocation.
4. **Reporting Rewards Contract** – Distributes rewards for verified poaching reports and conservation activities, integrated with oracles.
